# Dockerfile Approaches Comparison

## Approach 1: Using `eclipse-temurin` and Building Inside Docker

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk

WORKDIR /app

COPY .mvn/ .mvn
COPY mvnw pom.xml ./

RUN ./mvnw dependency:resolve

COPY src ./src

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["./mvnw", "spring-boot:run"]

```

**Advantages:**

- Simpler Setup
- Consistency in Build Environment
- Dependency Management

**Disadvantages:**

- Larger Image Size
- Slower Build Time
- Complexity in Multi-Stage Builds

---

## Approach 2: Using `openjdk:17-alpine` and Pre-built JAR

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  /app/jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]

```

**Advantages:**

- Smaller Image Size
- Faster Deployment
- Separation of Concerns

**Disadvantages:**

- Pre-Build Requirement
- Build Environment Management
- Potential Compatibility Issues

---

## Recommendation

For most production scenarios, **Approach 2** is generally preferred due to the smaller image size and faster deployment times. Hereâ€™s how you can optimize it further with a multi-stage build:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY .mvn/ .mvn
COPY mvnw pom.xml ./

# Resolve dependencies and build the application
COPY src ./src
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Run the application
FROM openjdk:17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "jpa-recursion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]

```

This way, we can get the benefits of both approaches: a clean build environment and a smaller, optimized runtime image.
