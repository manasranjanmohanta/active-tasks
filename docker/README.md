# What is Docker?

-  Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization.
- It is a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configurations
- Portable artifact, easily shared  and moved around.
- Makes development and deployment more efficient.

## Key Concepts of Docker

1. **Containers:**
    
    - **Definition:** Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
    - **Isolation:** They provide process and filesystem isolation, ensuring that an application running in a container will not interfere with applications running in other containers or on the host system.
2. **Images:**
    
    - **Definition:** A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. Images include the application code, libraries, and dependencies required to run the application.
    - **Layers:** Images are built in layers, where each layer represents a set of file changes or an instruction in the image build process. This makes image builds efficient as common layers can be reused.
3. **Dockerfile:**
    
    - **Definition:** A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. These instructions are executed step-by-step to create the final image.
    - **Example:**
	    Dockerfile:
        ```Dockerfile
        FROM openjdk:17-alpine

		WORKDIR /app
		
		COPY target/EmpolyeeManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar     /app/EmpolyeeManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
		
		EXPOSE 8080
		
		CMD ["java", "-jar", "EmpolyeeManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
		```
        
4. **Docker Engine:**
    
    - **Definition:** The Docker Engine is the runtime that builds and runs Docker containers. It consists of a server (a long-running daemon process), a REST API for interacting with the daemon, and a command-line interface (CLI).
5. **Docker Hub:**
    
    - **Definition:** Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service where users can create, store, and distribute Docker images. It provides a vast library of pre-built images for various software and applications.
6. **Volumes:**
    
    - **Definition:** Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside the container’s filesystem, ensuring data is not lost when the container stops or is removed.

## Benefits of Using Docker

1. **Portability:**

    - Containers can run consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production, regardless of underlying system differences.
2. **Efficiency:**

    - Containers are lightweight and share the host system’s kernel, allowing multiple containers to run on a single host with minimal overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.
3. **Scalability:**

    - Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by adding or removing container instances as needed.
4. **Isolation:**

    - Containers provide a secure environment by isolating applications from each other and the host system, reducing potential conflicts and enhancing security.
5. **Rapid Deployment:**

    - Docker enables faster and more reliable deployment cycles, allowing developers to build, test, and release code quickly.


## Typical Use Cases

1. **Microservices Architecture:**

    - Docker is ideal for building and managing microservices, where each service runs in its own container, making it easier to deploy, scale, and update services independently.
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

    - Docker integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, automating the build, test, and deployment processes, and ensuring consistency across environments.
3. **Development Environments:**

    - Developers use Docker to create consistent development environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

## Where do containers live?

- Container lives in container repository.
- Many companies have their own private repositories.
- There is also a public repositories for Docker that is **DockerHub**.

## Docker V/S Virtual Machine

  - **Size** : Docker images are smaller in size.
  - **Speed** : Docker containers start and rung much faster.
  - **Compatibility** : VM of any OS can run on any OS host but docker need some requirements.
