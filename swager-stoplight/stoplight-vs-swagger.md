# StopLight vs Swagger UI: What are the differences?

StopLight and Swagger UI are two popular tools for designing and documenting APIs. Let's explore the key differences between the two.

The main difference is -  Swagger is Open-Source but StopLight is not.

1. **Applicability**: StopLight offers a broader range of features beyond just API documentation, including design, mocking, and testing capabilities, making it suitable for end-to-end API lifecycle management. On the other hand, Swagger UI primarily focuses on generating interactive API documentation, making it more suitable for developers and API consumers.
    
2. **Interface**: StopLight provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface with an emphasis on a visual approach, allowing users to design and document APIs using a visual editor. Swagger UI, on the other hand, provides a more traditional code-centric approach where APIs are defined using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification) in JSON or YAML format.
    
3. **Customization**: StopLight offers greater flexibility in terms of customization options, allowing users to create custom themes, templates, and styles to match their brand identity. Swagger UI, on the other hand, provides limited customization options, mainly focused on changing the visual appearance of the documentation.
    
4. **Integration**: StopLight provides built-in integration with popular version control systems like GitHub and GitLab, allowing users to easily sync their API projects and collaborate with team members. Swagger UI, however, does not offer direct integration with version control systems and requires manual synchronization of changes.
    
5. **Mocking and Testing**: StopLight includes built-in mocking and testing capabilities, allowing users to simulate API behavior and test their APIs directly within the tool. Swagger UI, on the other hand, does not provide native mocking and testing features and requires additional tools or services to achieve the same functionality.
    
6. **Pricing**: StopLight offers a range of pricing plans, including free and enterprise options, allowing users to choose the plan that best fits their needs. Swagger UI, on the other hand, is an open-source project and is freely available for use without any licensing costs.
    

In summary, StopLight provides a comprehensive API lifecycle management solution with a visual interface, extensive customization options, built-in integration with version control systems, mocking, and testing capabilities, while Swagger UI focuses primarily on generating interactive API documentation using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) in a code-centric approach.
