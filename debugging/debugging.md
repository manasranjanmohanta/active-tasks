# What is Debugging?

#### Bug : 
- A software bug is an error flow or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.

#### Debugging :
- The process of identifying and removing the errors from the computer hardware or software.
- Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as "bugs") in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpected or crash.
- Debugging is the precess of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software.
- Debugging is a part of the software testing process.

## Why debugging is  needed?
- Debugging is an important part of determining why an operating system, application or program is misbehaving. Even if developers use the same coding standard , it's still likely that a new software program will still have bugs.
- In many cases, the process of debugging a new software program can take more time than it took to write the program .
- Invariably, the bugs in software components that got the most user are found and fixed first.

## Debugging v/s Testing
- Debugging and testing are complementary processes. 
- The purpose of testing is to **identify** what happens when there is a mistake in a program's source code.
- The purpose of debugging is to **locate and fix** the mistake.

## Debugging strategies
1. **Static analysis :** The developers examine the code without executing the program.
2. **Print debugging (also called tracking) :** The developer watches live or recorded print statement and monitors flow.
3. **Remote debugging :** The developer's debugger run in a different system than the program on a different system than the program that is begin debugged.
4. **Post-mortem debugging :** The developer only stops to debug the program if it experiences fatal exceptions.

## How to use Debugger?
**Step-1 : Add Breakpoints :** Breakpoints are the points or spot to which the programs runs and then stop/ hold the execution.
**Step-2 : Run with debug Mode :** To enable debugger provided by IDEs.

- **Step Over** - Go the next line of execution.
- **Step Into** - Go inside of method or classes.
- **Step Return** - Go back to previous line of execution.
